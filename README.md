🧠 Student Exam Performance Predictor
A full-stack Machine Learning web application that predicts students' math scores based on various academic and demographic inputs. Built with a modular ML pipeline, responsive UI, and deployed using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate end-to-end Machine Learning deployment by predicting student math performance based on features such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in reading and writing. It follows industry-standard practices in model development, frontend design, and cloud deployment.

📌 Features
✅ ML Pipeline: Linear Regression model built using Scikit-Learn with modular architecture (Data Ingestion → Data Transformation → Model Training → Prediction).

🌐 Web App: Flask-based backend with modern, responsive dark-themed frontend using HTML, CSS, and animation.

📦 Containerization: Dockerized the entire application for platform-independent deployment.

☁️ Deployment: Hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk; also publicly available on DockerHub.

🔁 MLOps Best Practices: Clean codebase with version control (GitHub), environment management, and logging.
